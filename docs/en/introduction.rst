Introduction
============

OWSLib is a Python package for client programming with `Open Geospatial Consortium`_ (OGC) web service (hence OWS) interface standards, and their related content models.

OWSLib was buried down inside PCL (Python Cartography Library), but has been brought out as a separate project.
