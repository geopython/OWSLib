Python doctest file to simulate a WPS Execute invocation with INVALID arguments.
This test does not execute any live HTTP request, rather it parses XML files containing pre-made HTTP responses.

Imports

    >>> from tests.utils import resource_file
    >>> from owslib.wps import WebProcessingService

Initialize WPS client

    >>> wps = WebProcessingService('http://cida.usgs.gov/climate/gdp/process/WebProcessingService')

Submit fake invocation of Execute operation using cached HTTP request and response
    >>> request = open(resource_file('wps_USGSExecuteInvalidRequest.xml'), 'r').read()
    >>> response = open(resource_file('wps_USGSExecuteInvalidRequestResponse.xml'), 'r').read()
    >>> execution = wps.execute(None, [], request=request, response=response)
    Executing WPS request...
    Execution status=ProcessFailed
     owslib.wps.WPSException : {'locator': None, 'code': None, 'text': 'Attribute null not found in feature collection'}

    >>> execution.isComplete()
    True

Display errors
    >>> for ex in execution.errors:
    ...     ex.code, ex.locator, ex.text
    ... 
    (None, None, 'Attribute null not found in feature collection')
