Python doctest file to simulate a WPS Execute invocation with INVALID arguments.
This test does not execute any live HTTP request, rather it parses XML files containing pre-made HTTP responses.

Imports

    >>> from tests.utils import resource_file, setup_logging
    >>> from owslib.wps import WebProcessingService
    >>> logger = setup_logging('INFO')

Initialize WPS client

    >>> wps = WebProcessingService('http://cida.usgs.gov/gdp/process/WebProcessingService')

Submit fake invocation of Execute operation using cached HTTP request and response
    >>> request = open(resource_file('wps_USGSExecuteInvalidRequest.xml'), 'r').read()
    >>> response = open(resource_file('wps_USGSExecuteInvalidRequestResponse.xml'), 'r').read()
    >>> execution = wps.execute(None, [], request=request, response=response)
