    >>> try:
    ...     response = wfs.getfeature(typename=['totally bogus'], maxfeatures=5)
    ... except ServiceException as e:
    ...     assert "msWFSGetFeature(): WFS server error. TYPENAME 'totally bogus' doesn't exist in this server.  Please check the capabilities and reformulate your request." in str(e)
