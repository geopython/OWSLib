  <Title>Atlas of the Cryosphere: Southern Hemisphere</Title>
  <Abstract>The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) Atlas of the Cryosphere is a map server that provides data and information pertinent to the frozen regions of Earth, including monthly climatologies of sea ice extent and concentration, snow cover extent, and snow water equivalent, in addition to glacier outlines, ice sheet elevation and accumulation, and more. In order to support polar projections, the Atlas is divided into two separate map servers: one for the Northern Hemisphere and one for the Southern Hemisphere. In addition to providing map images and source data through Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. (OGC) protocols (WMS, WFS, and WCS), a dynamic web interface for exploring these data is also available at http://nsidc.org/data/atlas. If you have questions, comments or suggestions, please contact NSIDC User Services at +1.303.492.6199 or nsidc@nsidc.org. The development of this map server application was supported by NASA&#39;s Earth Observing System (EOS) Program under contract NAS5-03099 and was developed using MapServer, an Open Source development environment for building spatially-enabled internet applications.

Digital media. Available at http://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0082.html. 01 November 2006. Background:  The high-resolution Radarsat Antarctic Mapping Project (RAMP) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) combines topographic data from a variety of sources to provide consistent coverage of all of Antarctica. Version 2 improves upon the original version by incorporating new topographic data, error corrections, extended coverage, and other modifications. The DEM incorporates topographic data from satellite radar altimetry, airborne radar surveys, the recently-updated Antarctic Digital Database (version 2), and large-scale topographic maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the Australian Antarctic Division. Data were collected between the 1940s and present, with most collected during the 1980s and 1990s. Although the RAMP DEM was created to aid in processing RAMP radar data, it does not utilize any RAMP radar data. The Atlas of the Cryosphere uses the RAMP DEM gridded at 1 km.</Abstract>

Background: The primary source for this database is the U.S. Defense Mapping Agency&#39;s (DMA) Operational Navigation Chart (ONC) 1:1,000,000 scale paper map series produced by the United States, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. These charts were designed to meet the needs of pilots and air crews in medium-and low-altitude en route navigation and to support military operational planning, intelligence briefings, and other needs. Level 0 (low resolution) coverage is global, and is entirely in the public domain. The National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) is a federal agency of the United States Government and is now known as the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).</Abstract>

Available at http://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0272.html. 24 August 2006. Background: Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) is an international project with the goal of surveying a majority of the world&#39;s estimated 160,000 glaciers. GLIMS uses data collected primarily by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument aboard the Terra satellite and the LANDSAT Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), along with historical observations. The GLIMS project is currently creating a unique glacier inventory, storing information about the extent and rates of change of all the world&#39;s glacial resources. GLIMS consists of many institutions called Regional Centers, who produce glacier analyses for their particular region. The GLIMS Glacier Database provides students, educators, scientists, and the public with reliable glacier data from these analyses. New glacier data are continually being added to the database.</Abstract>

Available at http://aadc-maps.aad.gov.au/aadc/metadata/metadata_redirect.cfm?md=AMD/AU/southern_ocean_fronts. 28 September 2006. Background: Hydrographic observations were used in this study of the Southern Ocean to improve our knowledge of large-scale aspects of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). The Antarctic Polar Front, also known as the Antarctic Convergence, is the southern front of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current that separates the Antarctic Zone in the south from the Polar Frontal Zone in the north. The Polar Front is taken by many to delineate the actual northern boundary of the Antarctic Zone. It is characterized by sea surface temperatures near 5-6 deg C and a salinity minimum of 33.8-34.0 psu produced by high rainfall.</Abstract>

Boulder, Colorado USA: National Snow and Ice Data Center. Digital Media. Background: The International Date Line (IDL), also known as just the Date Line, is an imaginary line on the surface of the Earth opposite the Prime Meridian which offsets the date as one travels east or west across it. Roughly along 180 deg longitude, with diversions to pass around some territories and island groups, it corresponds to the time zone boundary separating +12 and -12 hours GMT (UT1). Crossing the IDL travelling east results in a day or 24 hours being subtracted, and crossing west results in a day being added.</Abstract>

Background: Unlike snow dunes that are piles of drifted snow, Antarctic megadunes are long, undulating waves in the surface of the ice sheet that are 2 to 4 meters (6.5 to 13 feet) high and 2 to 5 kilometers (1 to 3 miles) apart. They are slightly rounded at their crests and are so subtle that a person on the ground cannot see the pattern. Regions of megadunes on the Antarctic ice sheet have been identified and outlined using satellite remote sensing imagery.</Abstract>

Many of the stations are staffed around the year. A total of 30 countries (as of October 2006), all signatory to the Antarctic Treaty, operate seasonal (summer) and year-round research stations on the continent and in its surrounding oceans. The population of persons doing and supporting science on the continent and its nearby islands varies from approximately 4,000 persons during the summer season to 1,000 persons during winter.</Abstract>

Background: Labels the location of the Magnetic South Pole, which in 2005 was computed to be 64.53 deg S, 137.86 deg E by the World Magnetic Model (WMM). The Earth&#39;s magnetic poles are the two points on the earth&#39;s surface at which magnetic meridians converge; the horizontal component of the magnetic field of the earth becomes zero at this point; also called the dip pole. The magnetic poles migrate over time.</Abstract>

Background: Labels the location of the Geomagnetic South Pole, which in 2005 was computed to be 79.74 deg S, 108.22 deg E by the World Magnetic Model (WMM). The Earth&#39;s geomagnetic poles are the points of intersection of the Earth&#39;s surface with the axis of a simple magnetic dipole that best approximates the Earth&#39;s actual, more complex magnetic field. If the Earth&#39;s magnetic field were a perfect dipole, then the field lines would be vertical at the geomagnetic poles and they would therefore coincide with the magnetic poles: however, the dipole approximation is in fact far from perfect, so in reality the magnetic and geomagnetic poles lie some distance apart. The geomagnetic poles migrate over time.</Abstract>

Background: Labels the location of the South Pole of Inaccessibility (85.83 deg S, 65.78 deg E), which is the point on the Antarctic continent farthest from the Southern Ocean. This pole was reached on December 14, 1958 by the 3rd Soviet Antarctic Expedition, led by Yevgeny Tolstikov. At that point they established a temporary station named Polyus Nedostupnosti.</Abstract>
