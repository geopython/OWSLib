        <Title>Canadian Important Bird Areas</Title>
        <Abstract>This layer represents *generalized* boundaries of Important Bird Areas (IBA) in Canada.  IBAs, in Canada and elsewhere, are evaluated and designated on the basis of internationally criteria.  The polygons contained in the dataset meet these criteria and are therefore deemed significant at the national, continental, or global level.  In Canada, IBAs are not legally recognized entities and therefore do not have any regulatory status.  Nevertheless, they are extremely useful for conservation planning for birds.  Polygon boundaries were digitized on-screen in ArcView GIS 3.2 by using NTDB 1:50K or 1:250K digital layers for reference.  If NTDB coverage was not available (e.g., far north), the Digital Chart of the World (1:1M) was used.  The boundaries of IBAs in this dataset are intentionally generalized to reflect the importance of the surrounding ecosystem on the values present within IBAs.  For example, small islands supporting colonies of seabirds might be buffered by 1 or 2 km to form an IBA.  Boundaries for a very small minority of IBAs were available in paper form as part of IBA conservation plans that had been developed previously.  In such cases, we visually estimated their boundaries against the NTDB or other base layers.  Many IBAs are already recognized as other types of protected areas, e.g., National Wildlife Areas, National and Provincial Parks, Migratory Bird Sanctuaries, conservation reserves, and so on.  In these cases, we used digital boundaries from other sources (e.g., WWF Canada's Designated Areas Database, Environment Canada's Canadian Conservation Areas Database) as reference points when digitizing IBA boundaries.

        <Title>Canadian Christmas Bird Count Locations</Title>
        <Abstract>A winter survey of bird populations conducted during the Christmas period - December 14 to January 5th inclusive.  More than 1800 counts are conducted each year across Canada, the United States and Latin America.  On a selected day within the count period, local birders count as many birds as possible within a 24 km (15 mile) diameter circle.  The Christmas Bird Count had long been organized on the continental scale by the New York-based National Audubon Society. In 2000, Audubon finalized an agreement with Bird Studies Canada that would see BSC partner with Audubon to coordinate CBCs in Canada.  This layer represents the centre point of all the Christmas Bird Counts conducted in Canada.  An accompanying layer (CBC_PY) contains the 24 km circles.</Abstract>

        <Abstract>The Breeding Bird Survey, initiated in 1966, is one of the oldest surveys of breeding birds in North America. It is conducted primarily by volunteers, who follow a predetermined, roadside route each year at the height of the breeding season.
